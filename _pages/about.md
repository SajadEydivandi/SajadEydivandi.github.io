Hi! I’m Sajad, a graduate student in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/" style="color: #0011DB; text-decoration: underline;">Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a>. I’m an autodidact programmer and a fearless problem solver with a deep enthusiasm for computers and electronics. As a self-driven engineer, I spend much of my time exploring, building, and learning new technologies with passion and focus. My hands-on experience spans a broad spectrum of ECE disciplines, allowing me to pick up new skills quickly, adapt to different challenges, and approach problems from various perspectives. Over the years, tackling complex design and programming projects has sharpened my problem-solving abilities. I also thrive in collaborative environments, where shared ideas and teamwork push projects to the next level.
