Hi! I’m Sajad, a Computer Engineering graduate student at <a href="https://www.iust.ac.ir/" style="color: #0011DB; text-decoration: underline;"> Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a>. I'm an autodidact engineer and a fearless problem solver with a strong passion for computers and electronics. As a self-taught programmer, I spend most of my time learning, building, and exploring new technologies with high energy and enthusiasm.

With hands-on experience across a wide range of ECE fields, I'm able to learn quickly, adapt fast, and tackle problems from multiple angles.

I bring strong problem-solving skills from years of working on challenging design and coding tasks, and I thrive in team environments where collaboration and idea exchange lead to better outcomes.
